# 🧠 Intelligent Malpractice Detection System (IMDS)

A lightweight, real-time AI-powered proctoring system for Computer-Based Testing (CBT). IMDS combines webcam-based gaze estimation with object detection to flag potential cheating behaviors without relying on the cloud or high-end hardware. It is optimized for deployment in West Africa and other resource-constrained environments.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 👁️ Real-time **gaze tracking** using mobilenetv2 that accepts input of left and right eye which is then concatenated and then used to learn features for on and offscreen gaze
-  **YOLOv8 object detection** to identify unauthorized items (e.g. phones, books)
-  Gaze-controlled **activation** of object detection for accuracy and efficiency
-  Works **offline** on low-end machines (≥ 4GB RAM)
-  Cross-platform: Windows, macOS (M1), and Linux
